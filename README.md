## Description

This is a personal portfolio project built as a monorepo. It is a solution to the ["Where's Waldo?" project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. This project aims to create a simple app that can simulate a "Where's Waldo?" game.

It is primarily intended to practice using node.JS to manage interactions between a backend and frontend app. This app uses a backend which contains the images to be rendered, _and the locations of the Waldo characters in pixel coordinates._ Users' inputs are compared against the backend and return success or failure if they successfully click on the Waldo characters (Waldo, Wilma and the Wizard).

## Deployment

This project's backend is deployed on Railway, and its front end is deployed on GitHub pages.

[See Live Preview here.](https://neo319.github.io/project-photo-tag/)

## Usage

To simulate a "Where's Waldo?" game, users can press on the start button to generate an image. They can then click anywhere on this image, which creates a drop-down menu. Users can choose which character is found where they clicked on the image (Waldo, Wilma, or the Wizard), depending on which characters are present in the image.

Core purpose:

- utilize prisma ORM to manage a more complex database.
- manage interactions between a frontend application and backend database.

## Technologies used
