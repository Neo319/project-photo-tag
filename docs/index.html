    curriculum. This project aims to create a simple app that can simulate a "Where's Waldo?" game.

    It is primarily intended to practice using node.JS to manage interactions between a backend and frontend app. This app uses a backend which contains the images to be rendered, and the locations of the Waldo characters in pixel coordinates. Users' inputs are compared against the backend and return success or failure if they successfully click on the Waldo characters (Waldo, Wilma and the Wizard).

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Click on the 'begin' button to load a "Where's Waldo?" Image.</li>
    <li>Search the image to find the characters -- waldo, wilma or the wizard.</li>
    <li>Click where this character is found, then select which character it is in the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>If all characters are found, you can reload the page to try again.</li>
    <li> <b>Note: you can use zoom to search the image, but there can be errors if you click while zoomed. Zoom out before clicking on the image.</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
